/*
It's time to select the fastest reindeer for Santa's journeys! ðŸ¦ŒðŸŽ„
Santa Claus has organized exciting reindeer races to determine which ones are in the best shape.

Your task is to display each reindeer's progress on a snow track in isometric format.

The information you receive:

indices: An array of integers representing each reindeer's progress on the track:
0: The lane is empty.
Positive number: The reindeer's current position from the beginning of the track.
Negative number: The reindeer's current position from the end of the track.
length: The length of each lane.
Return a string representing the race track:

Each lane has exactly length positions filled with snow (~).
Each reindeer is represented with the letter r.
Lanes are numbered at the end with /1, /2, etc.
The view is isometric, so the lower lanes are shifted to the right.
Examples:
*/
// drawRace([0, 5, -3], 10)
/*
  ~~~~~~~~~~ /1
 ~~~~~r~~~~ /2
~~~~~~~r~~ /3
*/

// drawRace([2, -1, 0, 5], 8)
/*
   ~~r~~~~~ /1
  ~~~~~~~r /2
 ~~~~~~~~ /3
~~~~~r~~ /4
*/

// drawRace([3, 7, -2], 12)
/*
  ~~~r~~~~~~~~ /1
 ~~~~~~~~r~~~ /2
~~~~~~~~~r~~ /3
*/
/**
 * @param {number[]} indices - The reno indices
 * @param {number} length - The length of the race
 * @returns {string} The reno race
 */
function drawRace(indices, length) {
  let race = [];

  for (let i = 0; i < indices.length; i++) {
    let position = indices[i];
    let line = "";

    if (position < 0) {
      line = `${"~".repeat(length + position)}r${"~".repeat(-position - 1)}`;
    } else if (position > 0) {
      line = `${"~".repeat(position)}r${"~".repeat(length - position - 1)}`;
    } else {
      line = "~".repeat(length);
    }
    race.push(`${" ".repeat(indices.length - i - 1)}${line} /${i + 1}`);
  }
  return race.join("\n");
}
